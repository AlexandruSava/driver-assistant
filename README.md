# Driver Assistant

In order to prepare the set up for this project, you need to install the Polestar 2 Emulator. 
For this please follow the instructions from https://www.polestar.com/us/developer/get-started/

For this project we used Java 11 JDK.

Once the Emulator is up and running. Try to run the app with user: abc@gmail.com and password: password
If it works, please press the button on the middle bottom in order to go back to the main page.
Then in the navbar, click on the 4-square-icon, open Google Maps, and turn On GPS. (this way, you'll
enable the GPS on the vehicle, otherwise our app won't work)
The last step, is to go back to the main page, then in the navbar press the last button on right side,
and please add your google account. After successfully done that, you have to open the emulator 
settings, go to Google Services tab and click update. A window with Google Play Services should
appear. Please press Update and wait for it to update.

After this, please close and open again the emulator. In this point, when running the app, you should
have all the functionalities working.
